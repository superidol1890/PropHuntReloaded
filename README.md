# Prop Hunt

A mod for [Among Us](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) which extends Hide and Seek into a new mode, Prop Hunt!


## How To Play
Prop Hunt uses the same rules and basics as Hide and Seek. Simply create a Hide and Seek lobby and select the "Prop Hunt" preset, or customize the settings to your liking!

## Controls
| Key | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `R` | Turn into nearest task |
| `Shift` | Move task |

*Note: You may get stuck when moving the task. Move the task back down before moving again.*

## Default Settings
| Settings | Effect | Default |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Prop Hunt | If prop hunt is enabled | True |
| Time Penalty | The amount of time subtracted from the timer on a missed kill | 10s |
<!-- Infection mode is currently disabled because Hide and Seek relies a lot on there only being one impostor! -->
<!-- | Infection Mode | Whether Props become Seekers when they are killed | True |  -->

## Installation
Download the zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/superidol1890/PropHuntReloaded/releases), and extract the contents into your Among Us game folder.

Although the mod *may* work on official servers, it is highly discouraged to do so, and will likely get you banned. Instead, try to setup your own modded server using [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) or another Reactor compatible server.
It is also designed to work well with other mods, but you may run into incompatibilities with certain tested mods. 
File an [issue](https://github.com/ugackMiner53/PropHunt/issues) if you find any problems!
